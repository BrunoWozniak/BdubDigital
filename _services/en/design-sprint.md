Unleash the power of Design Thinking in a focused, five-day workshop, regardless of location. Whether you're in the same room or spread across the globe, I'll guide your team through the Design Sprint process to rapidly develop, test, and de-risk your new product or service ideas.

## Here's what you can expect:
  > * **Pre-workshop preparation**: We'll work together to define your challenge, target audience, and desired outcomes.
  > * **Five-day intensive workshop**: I'll facilitate a collaborative process through key stages like understanding the problem, sketching solutions, prototyping, and conducting user testing.
  > * **Closure and documentation**: I'll synthesize learnings, document key decisions, and create a clear roadmap for next steps.
  > * **Optional iteration**: Based on user feedback and team insights, we can further develop the most promising solution or explore pivot opportunities through an additional sprint.

## Benefits:
  > * **Rapidly validate ideas**: Get user feedback and identify potential issues early in the development process.
  > * **Save time and resources**: Reduce the risk of investing in solutions that don't resonate with users.
  > * **Maximize team alignment**: Foster collaboration and shared understanding of user needs and priorities.
  > * **Increase the chance of success**: Make data-driven decisions based on real user feedback.

I offer both in-person and virtual Design Sprint facilitation, catering to your team's needs and preferences.
