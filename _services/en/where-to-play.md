Uncover and prioritize the most promising market opportunities for your business with my Market Opportunity Navigator © (also known as Where To Play) workshops. This structured framework helps you analyze a broad range of potential opportunities, assess their attractiveness, and ultimately define your focus for growth.

## Here's what you can expect:
  > * **Pre-workshop preparation**: We'll work together to define your challenge, target audience, and desired outcomes.
  > * **Five-day intensive workshop**: I'll facilitate a collaborative process through key stages like identifying and assessing opportunities, developping a roadmap.
  > * **Identify market opportunities**: We'll work together to brainstorm a wide range of potential market opportunities based on your core competencies and market trends.
  > * **Evaluate attractiveness**: We'll use the Market Opportunity Navigator © framework to assess each opportunity's attractiveness, considering factors like customer needs, market size, competition, and profit potential.
  > * **Develop a roadmap**: Based on the attractiveness assessment, I'll guide you in prioritizing opportunities and define a clear roadmap for pursuing the most promising ones.
  > * **Agile focus planning**: We'll utilize the Agile Focus Dartboard, a companion tool to the Market Opportunity Navigator ©, to define your primary market opportunity, explore backup options, and consider potential growth paths.

## Benefits:
  > * **Data-driven decision making**: Move beyond gut instinct and make educated choices based on a comprehensive evaluation of market opportunities.
  > * **Reduce risk**: Identify and mitigate potential pitfalls associated with different market options.
  > * **Optimize resource allocation**: Focus your resources on the opportunities with the highest potential for success.
