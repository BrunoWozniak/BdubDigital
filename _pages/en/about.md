# About me

# Making an impact

Here's what I bring to the table:

  > **Design Thinking Champion**: Adept at facilitating innovation workshops and user-centered problem solving.\
  > **Startup Methodology Advocate**: Experienced in rapid prototyping and validating concepts with customers.
  > **Solid Technology Background**: Skilled in building modern web and mobile apps, robust backends, and machine learning.
 
For over two decades, I've thrived in the dynamic world of technology. From IT and SaaS to logistics and cutting-edge communication satellites, I've honed my skills across various sectors. My passion lies in building digital solutions and applications that empower businesses: web and mobile apps, modern backends, and machine learning implementations.

And technology is just one piece of the puzzle. Over the past six years, I've transitioned into leading business innovation initiatives. Here, I discovered the power of design thinking and startup methodologies. These frameworks ignited my passion for helping teams **envision the future**, generate **net new growth opportunities**, and rapidly transform **ideas into prototypes validated by real customers**.

This shift wasn't just professional; it was personal. I witnessed the transformative power of innovation firsthand, and now I'm driven to share that experience. My goal is to **give back** and empower others to **unlock the potential** within their own teams and ideas.

**Let's work together to achieve results and make a real impact.**
